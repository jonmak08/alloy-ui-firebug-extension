# AlloyUI Devtools Extension for Chrome

## Instructions
Download the alloyui.crx file and drag it into Chrome. At the bottom in the area where the dowloads are usually placed, you'll get a prompt asking to install the plugin. Press Continue, and away you go. Just go to a page with AUI or YUI on it, and you're all set.
