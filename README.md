# AlloyUI Dev Extension

## About
This is a set of tools that extend the dev tools to allow you to use AlloyUI in a simpler manner.
The Firebug plugin for Firefox has more features (mainly around formatting the display of AlloyUI Nodes and Nodelists), and hopefully, I'll be able to add it to the Chrome one (I haven't found a way yet, but if you know, please send a pull or file an issue).
At the very least, they both expose a variable onto the window called "A" that is an instance of the YUI object with the aui-base module already loaded.
And if you have ideas for more features, a pull or an issue would be much appreciated :)

## Instructions
Go into the folder for the browser you want to add the extension to, download it, and load it up.
See the readme in each folder for more details.
